# AI Content Monetizer

A powerful WordPress plugin to monetize AI-generated content by locking it behind simple paywalls. Users pay a one-time micropayment to unlock premium content, generating passive income for bloggers and creators.[1][2][4][6]

## Features
- **Auto-lock AI content**: Automatically paywalls posts tagged with `ai-generated`.
- **Shortcode support**: Use `[aicm_paywall price="1.99"]Content[/aicm_paywall]` for custom paywalls.
- **Micropayments**: One-time unlocks via simulated payments (Stripe/PayPal ready for pro).
- **Admin settings**: Customize default prices and manage easily.
- **Self-contained**: No external dependencies; works out-of-the-box.
- **Freemium-ready**: Perfect base for premium upgrades like recurring payments or analytics.

## Installation

2. In WordPress admin: **Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin**.
3. Activate the plugin.
4. Go to **Settings > AI Content Monetizer** to set your default price.
