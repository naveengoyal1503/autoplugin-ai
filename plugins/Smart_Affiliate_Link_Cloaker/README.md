# Smart Affiliate Link Cloaker

A powerful WordPress plugin that automatically cloaks affiliate links in your posts and pages, tracks clicks, and provides performance stats to optimize your earnings.

## Features

- **Auto-Cloaking**: Automatically replaces affiliate URLs in post content with pretty cloaked links (e.g., yoursite.com/go/1).
- **Click Tracking**: Logs every click with nonce-secured AJAX for security.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Easy interface to add links and view real-time stats (name, cloaked URL, click count).
- **Shortcode Stats**: Use `[sac_stats]` to display stats on any page (admin-only).
- **Pretty Permalinks**: SEO-friendly /go/ID/ redirects.
- **Freemium Ready**: Free version limited to 10 links; Pro unlocks unlimited + analytics.
